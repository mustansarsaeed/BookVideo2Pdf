# Why BookVideo2Pdf?

Generating pdfs from Videos work also need attention. The idea of this project is to convert video of a book pages to selectable pdf pages using on-device machine learning technique. Idea will work as follows:

1. Start **BookVideo2Pdf** application and start video recording of a book for which you need to create pdf pages
2. Hold page from a corner and try to turn, application will detect using **on-device machine learning** that this page should be converted to Pdf page
3. PDF page will be created, which user can then select the text too. 

All the pages will be appended, and in the end you will get the single pdf with out the need to capture images first.

# All this work will help the users to generate selectable pdfs via capturing the videos of the books they want in a lesser time than first capturing.
